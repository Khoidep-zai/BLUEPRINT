description: "Use this skill any time a spreadsheet file is the primary input or output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .xltx, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas, formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch or from other data sources; or convert between tabular file formats. Trigger especially when the user references a spreadsheet file by name or path — even casually (like \"the xlsx in my downloads\") — and wants something done to it or produced from it. Also trigger for cleaning or restructuring messy tabular data files (malformed rows, misplaced headers, junk data) into proper spreadsheets. The deliverable must be a spreadsheet file. Do NOT trigger when the primary deliverable is a Word document, HTML report, standalone Python script, database pipeline, or Google Sheets API integration, even if tabular data is involved."

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis with OfficeCLI

> **NAB Preferred Tool:** In this environment, use the native single-binary **`officecli`** (`officecli.exe`) for all `.xlsx` workbook creation, cell editing, formula verification, and tabular data imports. No Python, `openpyxl`, or LibreOffice scripts are required.

## Quick CLI Capabilities

| Task | Preferred OfficeCLI Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Create blank workbook** | `officecli create model.xlsx` |
| **Inspect sheet / cells** | `officecli get model.xlsx "/sheet[1]/cell[A1]"` |
| **Import CSV into sheet** | `officecli import model.xlsx "/sheet[1]" data.csv` |
| **Set cell value / formula**| `officecli set model.xlsx "/sheet[1]/cell[C10]" --prop formula="=SUM(C2:C9)"` |
| **View sheet in text/HTML**| `officecli view model.xlsx text` (or `html`) |
| **Batch multiple cells** | `officecli batch model.xlsx --commands '[{"command":"set","path":"/sheet[1]/cell[A1]","props":{"value":"Revenue","bold":"true"}}]'` |
| **Validate schema & formula**| `officecli validate model.xlsx` |
| **Schema Help (No guessing)**| `officecli help xlsx cell` (or `officecli help xlsx sheet`) |

## Requirements for Every NAB Financial Output
- **Three-Sheet Standard:** Split work into `Assumptions` (inputs in blue), `Calculations` (engine in black), and `Summary` (KPIs & charts).
- **Zero formula errors:** Never ship a workbook containing `#REF!`, `#VALUE!`, `#DIV/0!`, or `#N/A`. Verify with `officecli validate`.
- **Dynamic Formulas Over Hardcoded Numbers:** Always write `=SUM(B2:B9)`, `=NPV(...)`, or `=XLOOKUP(...)`.
- **Currency & Precision:** Format AUD amounts as `"$#,##0.00"` adhering to Banker's Rounding (`HALF_EVEN`).
workbook.

**A green recalc proves your formulas *evaluate*, not that they are *right*.** An off-by-one
range or a reference to the wrong row yields a clean, error-free file with wrong numbers.
Write 2–3 formulas first and check they pull the values you expect, before building out a grid.

**A workbook that links to another file loses those links** if you re-save it with openpyxl and
then recalculate. Such a formula reads `='[1]Returns Analysis'!$B$2` — the `[1]` is an index
into the workbook's external-reference list, naming a *separate file on disk*, not a sheet.
That file is rarely present here, so the cell's cached value is the only thing holding its
data. openpyxl strips that value on save; LibreOffice then has to resolve the reference for
real, fails, writes `#NAME?`, and deletes every link. `recalc.py` refuses to run in that state
— copy those cells' values out of the original before you save over them (`--force` overrides,
and accepts the loss).

## Choosing formulas that survive verification

LibreOffice implements fewer functions than Excel, and one it cannot evaluate becomes a
literal `#NAME?` baked into the file you deliver.

- **Prefer Excel-2007-era functions** — `SUMIFS`, `INDEX`, `MATCH`, `IFERROR`, `SUMPRODUCT` — which need no prefix.
- **Six post-2007 functions work, but only with an `_xlfn.` prefix**, because openpyxl writes your formula into the XML verbatim and Excel stores post-2007 names prefixed (its UI hides the prefix): `_xlfn.TEXTJOIN`, `_xlfn.CONCAT`, `_xlfn.IFS`, `_xlfn.SWITCH`, `_xlfn.MAXIFS`, `_xlfn.MINIFS`. Written bare, each yields `#NAME?`.
- **Never use `XLOOKUP`, `XMATCH`, `SORT`, `FILTER`, `UNIQUE`, or `SEQUENCE`.** The runtime's LibreOffice cannot evaluate them under *any* prefix. Newer builds do evaluate them, but they are spilling array functions and an openpyxl-written file has no spill metadata, so only the top-left cell of the range gets a value — and `recalc.py` reports `total_errors: 0` on the truncated result. Use `INDEX`/`MATCH` for lookups, and sort, filter, and de-duplicate in Python before writing the cells.
- A formula LibreOffice could not parse is written back **lowercased** — a quick tell beside a `#NAME?`.

## openpyxl gotchas

- **Reading a model takes two loads.** `data_only=True` yields cached values with the formulas gone; the default yields formula strings with no values. One pass cannot give you both.
- **`data_only=True` is destructive if you save.** That workbook has no formulas left, so saving replaces every one with a literal — permanently.
- **`data_only=True` on a file openpyxl just wrote returns `None` everywhere** — run `recalc.py` first. (A formula whose result is `""` also reads back as `None`.)
- **Merged cells: write the top-left anchor only.** Every other cell in the range is a `MergedCell` whose `.value` is read-only.
- **`.xlsm` loses its macros unless you pass `keep_vba=True`** to `load_workbook`.
- **A sheet name containing a space must be quoted** in a cross-sheet reference: `='Assumptions Inputs'!$B$5`. Unquoted, it evaluates to `#VALUE!`.

## Financial models

Unless the user says otherwise, or the existing file already does something else.

**Color:** blue text (`0,0,255`) for hardcoded inputs and scenario levers · black for formulas ·
green (`0,128,0`) for links to another sheet · red (`255,0,0`) for links to another file ·
yellow fill (`255,255,0`) for key assumptions and cells the user should fill in.

**Numbers:** currency `$#,##0`, with the unit named in the header (`Revenue ($mm)`) · zeros
render as `-`, including in percentages (`$#,##0;($#,##0);-`) · negatives in parentheses ·
percentages `0.0%`, **stored as fractions** (`0.15` renders `15.0%`; storing `15` renders
`1500.0%`) · valuation multiples `0.0x` · years as text (`"2024"`, never `2,024`).

**Structure:** every assumption in its own labeled cell, referenced by the formulas that use it
(`=B5*(1+$B$6)`, never `=B5*1.05`) · formulas consistent across every projection period, since a
lone edited cell mid-row is the commonest silent error · guard denominators that can be zero.

## Dependencies

`openpyxl`, `pandas`, `markitdown` (pip, preinstalled — install only if an import fails or the command is missing) · LibreOffice (`soffice`, auto-configured for sandboxed environments via `scripts/office/soffice.py`)
